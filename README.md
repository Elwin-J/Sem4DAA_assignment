# Sem4DAA_assignment
Program to perform different sorting algos on an array. Outputting comparisons and time taken onto a file. <br>
Please Use this at your own risk. We kinda broke our heads trying to get this to work and it still doesn't feel right soooo.... the choice is yours :)<br>
Order of executions of sorts are selection, bubble, quick and merge sort. Same order is followed in both text files.<br>
